Project Motivation: 

This project focuses on a person’s mental health. Mental health is really important and crucial for healthy living. This app helps the individual battle challenges and gives them a safe space to heal. Some of the methods that are used in this project include journeys, journaling, and privacy for each individual to express their feelings. Moreover, the user is also given the option to share their feelings anonymously if needed.

This app takes in the user input about an individual's feelings. It keeps track of a person’s mood over time across a period, takes in their data from responses, and gives a score that will decide the next steps. The next steps include journeys where it shows text, images, or videos to make them feel better. Each journey is created based on the score that the individual got from their questionnaire. There would also be a journey record where they can look back at their days and see how they improved.

Functional Requirements:

Journey System: This feature assesses the daily input of the user and provides tailored advice depending on the user’s results. 

Mood Tracker: This feature asks the user a series of questions based on their current mood and provides a score based on levels of happiness, stress, exhaustion, etc. 


Journal System: After scoring the user on their current mood and providing advice and suggestions, the journal system allows the user to write down their thoughts and feelings. This helps the user process emotions and potentially alleviate stress, anger, and anxiety.

Calendar: The calendar system allows the user to select specific days to look back on their mood scores and journal entries to track their progress and improvement.

Login System: This allows users to be able to access their journal/account no matter what their device is. Moreover, it allows users to have a greater amount of security as a password is needed to view the sensitive information.

Feasibility Analysis
This project should be completed within 10 weeks. We are a beginner-level team, and we have decided to use Flutter for the front end, which is new to most of us, but we have worked with Git, VSC, and other developer tools, which reduced the time to learn it from scratch. The backend language that we are using is Python, and most people are familiar with this language. The learning time should take about 2 weeks at max, which gives us 8 weeks for deliverables/sprint planning. 

Despite being beginner developers, we’re confident we can finish the project in 10 weeks.  We know how to implement the functional requirements and have a good understanding of the time required to implement everything. All the students here are eager to learn and are willing to improve their software skills throughout this project. This type of work ethic is more than sufficient to complete this project within the period.
