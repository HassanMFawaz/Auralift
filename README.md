Project Motivation: 

This project focuses on a person’s mental health. Mental health is really important and crucial for healthy living. This app helps the individual battle challenges and gives them a safe space to heal. Some of the methods that are used in this project include journeys, journaling, and privacy for each individual to express their feelings. Moreover, the user is also given the option to share their feelings anonymously if needed.

This app takes in the user input about an individual's feelings. It keeps track of a person’s mood over time across a period, takes in their data from responses, and gives a score that will decide the next steps. The next steps include journeys where it shows text, images, or videos to make them feel better. Each journey is created based on the score that the individual got from their questionnaire. There would also be a journey record where they can look back at their days and see how they improved.
