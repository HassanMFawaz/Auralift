### Project Motivation

This project focuses on mental health, which is crucial for healthy living. Auralift is designed to help individuals manage challenges and provide a safe, private space to heal. The app includes features such as journeys, journaling, and the ability to share feelings anonymously.

Users input their daily emotions, and the app tracks mood trends over time. Based on their responses, a score is generated that guides the user to personalized journeys, which may include text, images, or videos for emotional support. A history of these journeys is recorded to help users reflect on their progress.

### Feasibility Analysis

This project is planned to be completed within 10 weeks. Although we are beginner-level developers, we are familiar with tools like Git and Visual Studio Code. While Flutter is new to most of the team, our prior experience will shorten the learning curve.

We estimate a 2-week learning phase, leaving 8 weeks for implementation and sprint planning. The team is confident in our ability to meet project goals and committed to continuous learning and collaboration throughout the development process.
